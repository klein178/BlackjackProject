/**
 * LiarClientListener.java
 *
 * This program implements a interface for playing Liars Dice.
 *
 * Liars Dice is played where every player rolls 5 dice, with the values known only to the player who rolled.
 * The Players then take turns guessing how many of a face of the die is present in all the die combined, 
 * including the dice of the other players, which are unknown values. The next player can either claim that there is
 * a higher number of die, or keep the number the same and increase the number of the face of the die.
 * For example, Player 1 says "four 5s"; Player 2 can either say "five 5s, (or any number greater than 5)", or
 * "four 6s"
 * If the player thinks the previous player is wrong/lying, they can call their bluff and if they are right, the first
 * player loses a die. If the they are wrong, than the person calling the bluff loses a die.
 *
 * The game continues until only one player has die left.
 *
 * Authors: Jed Klein and Connor Ford
 *
 * Data received is sent to the output screen, so it is possible that as
 * a user is typing in information a message from the server will be
 * inserted.
